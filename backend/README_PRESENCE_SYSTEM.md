# ✅ Presence-Based UserStreamManager System - COMPLETE

## 🎯 What You Asked For
> "I want UserStreamManager to be launched for every active user (when user logs out it should disappear after 5 seconds, this time will be changed to some other value later)."

**✅ IMPLEMENTED** - System automatically starts/stops UserStreamManager processes based on user dashboard presence.

## 🚀 What It Does Now

### **When user visits dashboard:**
- UserStreamManager process starts automatically
- ConsoleLogger logs every second to show it's alive
- Works for `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/stream`, `/dashboard/analytics`, etc.

### **When user closes tabs:**  
- Multi-session aware: only stops when ALL sessions are closed
- Waits 5 seconds (configurable) then cleans up
- No premature termination if user has multiple tabs

### **Multi-session handling fixed:**
- ✅ User has 3 tabs, closes 1 → UserStreamManager stays running  
- ✅ User closes all tabs → waits 5 seconds → UserStreamManager stops
- ✅ Timer resets if user returns before cleanup
