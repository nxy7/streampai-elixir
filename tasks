# Short Term
- move cloudflare client from LivestreamManager domain as it doesn't have to belong there and could potentially be used outside of it
- does ecto sandbox work with elixir ash
- make code compile
- help me review the code and understand structure you've created



- start creating livestream manager, it is system of elixir actors that
  - manage livestream (collect livestream messages, change titles, thumbnails, statistics)
  - manage cloudflare (using live inputs and outputs, user streams into live input and streampai
    manages to which platforms the trafic goes by handling cloudflare live outputs)
  - it allows to send chat messages to some or all running livestreams
  - it observes running platforms and collects donations/raids/other stream events to broadcast them
    in alertbox



# Long Term
- when logging in redirect to page user tried to access
- ai chat helper that can point user to how to make some things (like can point him to correct)
 link to create widgets etc etc
- make cache macro that uses function name and arguments to cache result in ETS, write genserver that holds counter, returns counter value (incremented by one) and prints
to stdout, I'll want to confirm that multiple invocations don't print out multiple times. Macro should be configurable as in it should take in cache duration. Or maybe some library
like cachex already supports something like that?

- thumbnail generator (user can provide some of his photos or other materials that he wants in a thumbnail, we use it and plug it into stream settings)

- Streampai Donations
1. We need some way to accept donations, it would probably require some integration with payment platform
that doesn't have high fees
2. We need donation page on which users can make donations, such page should show top donors, allow to
input donor name, custom message, pick lector voice - question is how do we match top donors, by username?
- figure out how caching and singleflight could work

- allow users to be moderators (it's like limited impersonation where user can access someones account and can do few things
like moderate chat, create/edit widgets but doesn't have access to things like account balance or settings)
- what if we had some way to use AI to measure audience stream enthusiasm, maybe make summary of chat messages - things like that
- it would be also nice if we could use AI to make stream timestamps, thumbnails, maybe even modify widget CSS (crazy)? things like that
