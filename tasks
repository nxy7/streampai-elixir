# Short Term
- can we try moving the session from :ets to session again
- in chat messages in widget settings two messages are added at a time, is it possible that some timer is not being
cleaned up correctly? Weird thing is that if I open this page from URL messages are duplicated, I also see
[(streampai 0.1.1) lib/streampai_web/live/chat_widget_settings_live.ex:15: StreampaiWeb.ChatWidgetSettingsLive.mount/3]
"connecting" #=> "connecting"

[info] CONNECTED TO LiveDebugger.Client.Socket in 27µs
  Transport: :websocket
  Serializer: Phoenix.Socket.V2.JSONSerializer
  Parameters: %{"socketID" => "phx-GGDU2H-bBWVrWQPG", "vsn" => "2.0.0"}
[info] JOINED client:phx-GGDU2H-bBWVrWQPG in 49µs
  Parameters: %{}
[(streampai 0.1.1) lib/streampai_web/live/chat_widget_settings_live.ex:15: StreampaiWeb.ChatWidgetSettingsLive.mount/3]
"connecting" #=> "connecting"
meaning that we're connecting to WS twice - hence duplicated message schedulation. But if I go to the page from other page
(manual navigation), then it's connecting just once and doesn't schedule messages twice.

- we now use streams in chat widget, but if I use limit then after reaching that limit new
messages stop showing up
- need better name for chat related files because right now I don't know which one is in settings page, which one
is stateless component and which one is supposed to be used in OBS
- sidebar collapse doesnt work on /widgets/chat but works on other pages?! 
- figure out deployment, I think that for starters docker compose on VPS will be sufficient


# Long Term
- when logging in redirect to page user tried to access
- ai chat helper that can point user to how to make some things (like can point him to correct)
 link to create widgets etc etc
- make cache macro that uses function name and arguments to cache result in ETS, write genserver that holds counter, returns counter value (incremented by one) and prints
to stdout, I'll want to confirm that multiple invocations don't print out multiple times. Macro should be configurable as in it should take in cache duration. Or maybe some library
like cachex already supports something like that?

- Streampai Donations
1. We need some way to accept donations, it would probably require some integration with payment platform
that doesn't have high fees
2. We need donation page on which users can make donations, such page should show top donors, allow to
input donor name, custom message, pick lector voice - question is how do we match top donors, by username?
- figure out how caching and singleflight could work

- fix user policy (not it has authorize_if always())
- allow users to be moderators (it's like limited impersonation where user can access someones account and can do few things
like moderate chat, create/edit widgets but doesn't have access to things like account balance or settings)
- what if we had some way to use AI to measure audience stream enthusiasm, maybe make summary of chat messages - things like that
- it would be also nice if we could use AI to make stream timestamps, thumbnails, maybe even modify widget CSS (crazy)? things like that
