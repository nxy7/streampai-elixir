- move the app to the root level of the repository
- start collecting stream messages/metrics/events
- when user donates we should schedule oban job that will check if we have generated
TTS message and if not we should use some TTS provider to get it (probably we
should save them using message+TTS option hash so we can look up the hash)
and then broadcast alertbox event with necessary event details and TTS path
