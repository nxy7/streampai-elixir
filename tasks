# Short Term
- add yearly discount info on /dashboard/settings
- clicking on sidebar icon should lead back to landing page
- you created landing page components to make the code more reusable, use that (I think right now landing page
is still one big component)
- make pages for Privacy Terms Support and Contact and plug then on landing page
- make adding youtube/twitch accounts functional
- in settings allow users to set their own names
- add new "coming soon" features like "Donations" which will allow streamers to accept donations through
streampai with lower Fees than streaming platforms
- make dashboard sidebar so that it's a bit more spaced out (maybe divide tabs into 2 sections) 
- add logout option
- make separate 'widget' page that's blank and can be used on stream, it should probably sit at /w/{uuid}
path, then backend can query widget in database using said ID, check what widget type that is and display
it conditionally. If no widget with said ID is found then display such message.
- create simple widget, for starters let's create carousel widget that displays images in carousel
- create livestream chat widget, for starters it should just create some fake messages and display them
in a loop (it's fine to display max 40-50 messages). Later it will plug into some actor probably


# Long Term
- Streampai Donations
1. We need some way to accept donations, it would probably require some integration with payment platform
that doesn't have high fees
2. We need donation page on which users can make donations, such page should show top donors, allow to
input donor name, custom message, pick lector voice - question is how do we match top donors, by username?
- figure out how caching and singleflight could work
