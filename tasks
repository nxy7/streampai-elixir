# Short Term
- can we persist sessions across app restarts? Right now we're using ETS so that might be hard
- on sidebar move users into separate Admin category, it should also have /dashboard/admin/users path. Fix paths wherever it's used.
- I need some way to monitor the app, CPU usage, memory usage of all nodes, what are my options? This should also be exposed just to specific IP
that would be hardcoded (I guess)
- also I need some way to monitor errors, if user sees error I think I should have it saved somewhere so I can inspect it
- use streaming accounts in Quick Actions on dashboard and in each place that refers to connected platforms (like settings)

- make cache macro that uses function name and arguments to cache result in ETS, write genserver that holds counter, returns counter value (incremented by one) and prints
to stdout, I'll want to confirm that multiple invocations don't print out multiple times. Macro should be configurable as in it should take in cache duration. Or maybe some library
like cachex already supports something like that?

- in settings allow users to set their own names
	- in settings add some ecto validation on user name with feedback when user writes (like name
	has to be alphanumeric and longer than 3 chars)
	- how to implement additional check on this field, checking if username is taken (with debounce
	so we don't run this check on every character input)
	- finally allow saving the name
- create simple widget, for starters let's create carousel widget that displays images in carousel
- create livestream chat widget, for starters it should just create some fake messages and display them
in a loop (it's fine to display max 40-50 messages). Later it will plug into some actor probably


# Long Term
- figure out a way for llm to inspect the app (Tidewave?)
- Streampai Donations
1. We need some way to accept donations, it would probably require some integration with payment platform
that doesn't have high fees
2. We need donation page on which users can make donations, such page should show top donors, allow to
input donor name, custom message, pick lector voice - question is how do we match top donors, by username?
- figure out how caching and singleflight could work

- implement impersonation based on role, for now treat user with 'lolnoxy@gmail.com' email
as :admin and all others as :regular. Admin can impersonate anyone, regular cannot impersonate
anyone. That might mean that we need some way to put :current_user and :impersonator into
assigns, but I'm not 100% sure about that yet
- fix user policy (not it has authorize_if always())
- fix mneme tests so that they correctly assert input
- allow users to be moderators (it's like limited impersonation where user can access someones account and can do few things
like moderate chat, create/edit widgets but doesn't have access to things like account balance or settings)
- what if we had some way to use AI to measure audience stream enthusiasm, maybe make summary of chat messages - things like that
- it would be also nice if we could use AI to make stream timestamps, thumbnails, maybe even modify widget CSS (crazy)? things like that
