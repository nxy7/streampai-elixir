# Short Term
- create livestream chat widget, for starters it should just create some fake messages and display them
in a loop (it's fine to display max 40-50 messages). Later it will plug into some actor probably
- create simple widget, for starters let's create carousel widget that displays images in carousel
- figure out deployment, I think that for starters docker compose on VPS will be sufficient


# Long Term
- make cache macro that uses function name and arguments to cache result in ETS, write genserver that holds counter, returns counter value (incremented by one) and prints
to stdout, I'll want to confirm that multiple invocations don't print out multiple times. Macro should be configurable as in it should take in cache duration. Or maybe some library
like cachex already supports something like that?

- Streampai Donations
1. We need some way to accept donations, it would probably require some integration with payment platform
that doesn't have high fees
2. We need donation page on which users can make donations, such page should show top donors, allow to
input donor name, custom message, pick lector voice - question is how do we match top donors, by username?
- figure out how caching and singleflight could work

- fix user policy (not it has authorize_if always())
- allow users to be moderators (it's like limited impersonation where user can access someones account and can do few things
like moderate chat, create/edit widgets but doesn't have access to things like account balance or settings)
- what if we had some way to use AI to measure audience stream enthusiasm, maybe make summary of chat messages - things like that
- it would be also nice if we could use AI to make stream timestamps, thumbnails, maybe even modify widget CSS (crazy)? things like that
