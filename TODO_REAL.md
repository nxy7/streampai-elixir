# Fix all tests, start deep refactoring session to ensure quality and maintainable code

# Implement 'support chat' system

- backend machinery to make 'support chat' work
- user can create 'new chat' which shows up in '/admin/support' page
- admin can chat with user from that page
- admin can mark chat as 'resolved' which ends the chat (user still can access 'past chats')

Then add other actions on button that opens 'chat with Streampai' like

- request a feature
- report a bug
